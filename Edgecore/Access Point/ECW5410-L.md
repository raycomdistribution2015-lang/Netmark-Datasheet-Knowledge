Datasheet The ECW5410-L is a concurrent dual-band 802.11ac Wave 

2 high-density access point. Featuring dual 4x4 Multi-User 

MIMO (MU-MIMO) radios, the ECW5410-L can simultaneously 

support up to 800 Mbps and 1.73 Gbps data rates for both 

2.4GHz and 5GHz bands, far surpassing the throughput of 

the latest 802.11ac Wave 1 access points. It provides a Gigabit 

LAN port for Ethernet-capable network devices and a built-

in Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacon that can be used for 

targeted marketing campaigns. The combination 802.11ac 

Wave 2 MU-MIMO technology and 4x4 spatial streams makes 

the ECW5410-L a top choice for high-density environments 

such as stadiums, arenas, and conference rooms. 

The TIP open ECW5410-L AP hardware is pre-installed with 

TIP’s Open AP software, saving time and hassle from software 

installation, but at the same time reserve the flexibility for 

further changes. From SMB to MDUs to larger venues, the 

TIP open ECW5410-L is a flexible hardware platform for the 

different network use cases and requirements.
