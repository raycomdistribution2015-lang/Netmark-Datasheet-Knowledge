## WIRELESS LAN CONTROLLER

##### **INTRODUCTION**

The EWS5204 is an enterprise-grade wireless LAN controller that provides establishments such as
hotels, universities, or even complete municipalities with a comprehensive set of managed Wi-Fi
features at a competitive license-free price point. With AP management, user authentication,
policy assignment, traffic shaping, firewall features, and much more all packaged into a single box,
the EWS5204 provides network administrators with a reliable, easy-to-use, and centralized
management console for an entire organization’s wireless network infrastructure.


The EWS5204 is capable of managing up to 1,000 ECW/ECWO-series Wireless Access Points and
can be directly integrated with unified access switches, all of which can be deployed and
configured easily by anyone, including non-wireless savvy users. For example, automated AP
discovery prevents network administrators from having to go through the hassle of individually
adding and configuring each access point. Access points as well as connected Wi-Fi devices can
then be monitored and managed from a centralized point, with extensive logging & reporting
features to assist in troubleshooting and maintenance.


As Wi-Fi enabled handheld devices such as smartphones and tablets become ever so prevalent in
our daily lives, businesses and network operators alike are faced with a mind-boggling dilemma –
how to simultaneously address the needs of BYOD (Bring Your Own Device), manage Wi-Fi users,
and maintain network service quality for mission critical applications. The EWS5204 is designed
exactly with these requirements in mind, and with a total cost of ownership that satisfies even the
most price conscious, organizations are guaranteed to receive an unmatched ROI on their wireless
LAN infrastructure.

##### **FEATURES**

**SECURITY**


Security is often one of the most important concerns
when it comes to enterprise wireless networks. From
the most basic need of preventing network access by
unauthorized users to performing rogue AP detection
and enforcing network isolation, the Edgecore
Controllers provide a complex set of features that
prevent malicious activities in an organization's
network.


For deployment flexibility, the Edgecore Controllers
support user authentication via both the industry
standard 802.1X as well as web-based captive portals.
The highly customizable captive portals with integrated
walled garden capability can be adapted to suit the
needs of hotels, schools, and other public venues. For
unregistered users without an account, guest access
can be provided by simply entering an e-mail address,
logging in with social media accounts, or purchasing a
data plan through PayPal.


With various account generation methods, the
Edgecore Controllers are able to identify users and
track user activities, ensuring network security in public
Wi-Fi.


The Edgecore Controllers also support remote access
via VPN, which is crucial for travelling businessmen. At
the same time, site-to-site VPN establishes secure
connections between corporate headquarters and
branch offices.

**MOBILITY**


The advent of the era of smartphones and tablets has
opened a chasm between how the Internet is used
and how organizations provide Internet connectivity.
Wireless networks have transformed from a luxury to
a necessity, in order to support devices that don't
have legacy wired capability. Furthermore, additional
features need to be provided in order to address the
rapidly changing usage behavior.


The Edgecore Controllers support a variety of mobility
features that aim to make enterprise Wi-Fi both easier
to use and simpler to manage. For example, by
supporting fast roaming, users on mobile devices can
be on-the-go without worrying about interrupted
connections. It is also not uncommon to see a single
user with multiple handheld devices - with the
Edgecore Controller all of the devices can login to WiFi using the same username and password. Finally,
mobile-optimized captive portals and ticket-printed
QR code automatic login are both easy methods for a
user to get online from their mobile device.

**MANAGEMENT**


In a wireless LAN, the Edgecore controller is the
central point of management for network
administrators, whether it is monitoring current
online users or troubleshooting network connectivity
issues. The management console of the Edgecore
controller is a browser-based GUI that is simple and
intuitive to operate. From this interface, network
administrators can configure traffic shaping profiles,
track previous network usage, perform system backup
and restore, and much more.


From the user management perspective, one of the
core benefits of the Edgecore controller is its ability to
enforce different traffic profiles based on both the
location (Service Zone) of the user and the time of
access. For example, the profiles applied during work
hours can be different from that of during after-work
hours. From bandwidth limitations to specific routing
rules, network administrators gain fine-grained
control over Wi-Fi users.


For access points, the Edgecore Controllers support
automatic discovery and provisioning, eliminating
many repetitive and cumbersome tasks often faced
during initial network deployment. Centralized AP
configuration and monitoring also greatly reduces
maintenance overhead for IT staff.

As wireless networks increasingly become the primary
network used by organizations, it is crucial to take into
consideration fundamental network services, such as
DHCP, NAT, and routing. In addition to providing these
functions, the Edgecore controller also implements
the concept of a "Service Zone", which essentially
segments the controller into multiple virtual
controllers, each with its own associated network
services, user policies, authentication settings, etc.


On the reliability end, the Edgecore controller
supports WAN port failover, which helps businesses
reduce the chance of network downtime and prevents
lost productivity and revenue. Furthermore, load
balancing between the WAN ports increases overall
performance by alleviating congestion and distributing
traffic between the two outgoing links.


Finally, the Edgecore controller provides unique valueadded capabilities, such as a direct integration with
Micros Opera PMS that greatly simplifies the
overhead of providing managed Wi-Fi in hotels.



**REPORTING**


Whether it is real-time monitoring of network activity
or tracking the usage of previous Wi-Fi users, network
administrators need the appropriate tools at their
disposal to increase efficiency and reduce workload.
The Edgecore Controllers have an extensive set of
logging and reporting features that allow network
administrators to easily find any information related
to the wireless network.


The built-in system dashboard provides a quick
overview of the current system status, along with
graphical reports of network traffic and system
performance. In addition, there is a simple interface
for viewing online devices and their associated
detailed statistics, including but not limited to the
roles they belong to, enforced network policies, and
packets transferred.


Alongside network monitoring, the Edgecore
controller also performs detailed logging of all
network activity. For example, the User HTTP Web Log
allows network administrators to track users who
visited malicious websites, while the DHCP Lease Log
can assist in troubleshooting clients who cannot
receive an IP address. Lastly, the Configuration
Change Log shows administrators which settings have
been modified in the past, in case there are
configuration errors that need to be reverted.
