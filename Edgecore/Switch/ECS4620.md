Enterprise Solution ECS4620 Series L3 Gigabit Ethernet Stackable Switch 

## Product Overview 

The Edgecore ECS4620 Series is a family of high-performance Gigabit Ethernet Layer 3 switches featuring 28 or 52 ports; with 24 /48 10/100/1000BASE-T ports, 2 10G SFP+ ports, and one 10G dual port expansion slot. The switches are ideal for high-performance server aggregations, such as enterprise data centers, where they can connect high-end or network-attached files servers over fiber ports. They can also be deployed as a backbone upgrade, or to provide Gigabit–to-the-desktop for power users. These switches are packed with features and are a cost-effective solution that bring continuous availability, enhanced security, and advanced QoS to the network edge, while maintaining simplicity of management. 

## Key Features and Benefits Performance and Scalability 

The ECS4620 Series includes high-performance Gigabit Ethernet Layer 3 managed switches with 128/176 Gbps switching capacity. The switches deliver wire-speed switching performance on all Gigabit ports, taking full advantage of existing high-performance PCs by significantly improving the responsiveness of applications and file transfer times. 

Continuous Availability 

The IEEE 802.1w Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol provides a loop-free network and redundant links to the core network with rapid convergence, ensuring a faster recovery from failed links and enhancing overall network stability and reliability. The IEEE 802.1s Multiple Spanning Tree Protocol runs STP per VLAN base, providing Layer 2 load sharing on redundant links for up to 32 instances. The ECS4620 Series supports IEEE 802.3ad Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP). It increases bandwidth by automatically aggregating several physical links together as a logical trunk and offers load balancing and fault tolerance for uplink connections. The ECS4620 Series supports G.8032 Ethernet Ring Protection Switching, with the ability for the network to detect and recover from incidents without impacting users, meeting the most demanding quality and availability requirements. Rapid recovery time when problems do occur is as low as 50 msec. 

Comprehensive QoS 

The ECS4620 Series offers advanced QoS for marking, classification, and scheduling to deliver best-in-class performance for data, voice, and video traffic at wire speed. Eight egress queues per port enable differentiated management of up to eight traffic types through the switch. Traffic is prioritized according to 802.1p and DSCP to provide optimal performance for real-time applications. Weighted Round Robin (WRR) and strict priority ensure differential prioritization of packet flows and avoid congestion of ingress and egress queues. Asymmetric bidirectional rate-limiting, per port or per traffic class, preserves network bandwidth and allows maximum control of network resources. The ECS4620 Series supports Three Color Marker and Policing Single rate: Committed Information Rate (CIR) Two rate: CIR + Peak Information Rate (PIR) Traffic Policing: Which drop or remark the priority tags of packets when they exceed burst size. 

Enhanced Security 

Port Security limits the total number of devices using a switch port and protects against MAC flooding attacks. IEEE 802.1X port-based or MAC-based access control ensures all users are authorized before being granted access to the network. When a user is authenticated, the VLAN, QoS, and security policy are automatically applied to the port where the user is connected, otherwise the port is grouped in a guest VLAN with limited access. DHCP snooping allows a switch to protect a network from rogue DHCP servers to offer invalid IP address. IP Source Guard prevents people from using IP addresses that were not assigned to them. Access Control Lists (ACLs) can be used to restrict access to sensitive network resources by denying packets based on source and destination MAC addresses, IP addresses, or TCP/UDP ports. ACLs are hardware supported, so switching performance is not compromised. Secure Shell and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL/HTTPS) encrypt Telnet and web access to the switch, providing secure network management. Private VLANs (traffic segmentation per port) isolates edge ports to ensure user privacy. DAI (Dynamic ARP Inspection) is a security feature that validates Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) packets in a network. DAI allows a network administrator to intercept, log, and discard ARP packets with invalid MAC-to-IP address bindings. 

Simple Management 

An industry-standard command-line interface (CLI), accessed through the console port or Telnet, provides a familiar user interface and command set for users to manage the switch. 

Layer 3 Features IPv4 Static Route 

The ECS4620 Series supports hardware-based IPv4 routing for maximum performance. Routing protocols, such as RIP v1/v2, and static routes are supported. * IPv6 Ready Logo for ECS4620-28F under certification process
